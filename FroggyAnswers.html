Flexbox Froggy Homework & Reasons why it works

flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; 
  This wraps the content and reverses the content so that when you next do the flex-direction, the color order matches the lily pad order
flex-direction: column-reverse; 
  This puts the content into columns and reverses the order so that the red lily pad is now at the bottom
align-content: space-between;  
  This splits the two columns so that they're now on opposite sides of the "water"
justify-content: center; 
  And finally, this puts the content in the center of the "water's edge", aligning the content properly
